                            In the late summer of that year we lived in a house
                            in a village that looked across the river and the
                            plain to the mountains. In the bed of the river
                            there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in
                            the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving
                            and blue in the channels.

                            The Metamates moniker was coined by Douglas
                            Hofstadter, a professor of cognitive science at
                            Indiana University and author of the Pulitzer
                            Prize-winning book “Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal
                            Golden Braid.” In a tweet, Andrew Bosworth, Meta's
                            chief technology officer, said an employee had
                            emailed Mr. Hofstadter for ideas for a rebrand.<br />
                            In an email, Mr. Hofstadter said he had originally
                            suggested “teammate” to describe Meta's employees,
                            since each half of the word is an anagram of Meta.
                            In a postscript, he recommended Metamate as an
                            alternative. He added that he was unaware the
                            company had adopted the name.<br />

                            he wrote. “In fact, I avoid all social media. That's
                            not my style at all. But email I do use!”

                            mathematics offers no useful or practical
                            applications to society?<br />
                            Salviati: Of course not. I'm merely suggesting that
                            just because something happens to have practical
                            consequences, doesn't mean that's what it is about.

                            mathematics is to engage in an act of discovery and
                            conjecture, intuition and inspiration; to be in a
                            state of confusion- not because it makes no sense to
                            you, but because you gave it sense and you still
                            don't understand what your creation is up to; to
                            have a breakthrough idea; to be frustrated as an
                            artist; to be awed and overwhelmed by an almost

                            The attacks on September the 11th shocked America
                            because no-one had seen them coming. The phrase
                            constantly used was, "We failed to join up the
                            dots." And in the state of fear, the government
                            passed the Patriot Act. It said that everyone's
                            personal data must be open to examination, to stop
                            further attacks. Privacy of the individual now
                            became irrelevant in the face of a much higher need
                            - security. It meant that the very thing that Google
                            had invented, looking for patterns in a mass of
                            data, now became central to the security of the
                            United States. And the threat of new laws to stop
                            Google collecting as much data on people as they
                            wanted faded away. <br />
                            <br />
                            The shock of the attacks of 9/11 began a shift away
                            from the individualism that had been at the centre
                            of America since the 1950s. And Google was going to
                            become central to that shift. Because rather than
                            doing what they had originally dreamed of, giving
                            people data so they could make their own stories,
                            what Google were now doing was TAKING people's data
                            and using it to predict what those individuals would
                            do, without having to ask them anything. <br />
                            <br />
                            What they thought or felt as individuals and the
                            stories they told themselves was completely
                            irrelevant. Consciousness was being sidelined even
                            more.

                            Creativity is more than just being different.
                            Anybody can plan weird; that's easy. What's hard is
                            to be as simple as Bach. Making the simple,
                            awesomely simple, that's creativity

                        <blockquote>
                            When Deng Xiaoping visited the United States in
                            1979, the actress Shirley MacLaine told him how
                            impressed she had been on a visit to China during
                            the Cultural Revolution, when Mr. Deng and countless
                            others had been forced to toil in remote areas and
                            ``learn from the peasants.'' The actress said she
                            had been particularly moved by a scholar working in
                            a field, who had described how much more fulfilling
                            it was to grow tomatoes than to work in a
                            university. <br />Mr. Deng looked at her and said:
                            ``He lied.''

                            If there is one “scientific” discovery I am proud
                            of, it is the discovery of the habit of writing
                            without publication in mind. I experience it as a
                            liberating habit: without it, doing the work becomes
                            one thing and writing it down becomes another one,
                            which is often viewed as an unpleasant burden. When
                            working and writing have merged, that burden has

                            is that it's essentially

                            Matter and energy had ended and with it space and
                            time. Even AC existed only for the sake of the one
                            last question that it had never answered from the
                            time a half-drunken computer [technician] ten
                            trillion years before had asked the question of a
                            computer that was to AC far less than was a man to
                            Man.<br />
                            All other questions had been answered, and until
                            this last question was answered also, AC might not
                            release his consciousness.<br />
                            All collected data had come to a final end. Nothing
                            was left to be collected.<br />
                            But all collected data had yet to be completely
                            correlated and put together in all possible
                            relationships.<br />
                            A timeless interval was spent in doing that.<br />
                            And it came to pass that AC learned how to reverse
                            the direction of entropy. But there was now no man
                            to whom AC might give the answer of the last
                            question. No matter. The answer -- by demonstration
                            -- would take care of that, too.<br />

                        <b>Evil</b>
                        <blockquote>
                            It was granted me to carry away from my prison years
                            on my bent back, which nearly broke beneath its
                            load, this essential experience; how a human being
                            becomes evil and how good. In the intoxication of
                            youthful successes I had felt myself to be
                            infallible, and I was therefore cruel. In the
                            surfeit of power I was a murderer, and an oppressor.
                            In my most evil moments I was convinced that I was
                            doing good, and I was well supplied with systematic
                            arguments. And it was only when I lay there on
                            rotting prison straw that I sensed within myself the
                            first stirrings of good. Gradually it was disclosed
                            to me that the line separating good and evil passes
                            not through states, nor between classes, nor between
                            political parties either—but right through every
                            human heart—and through all human hearts. This line
                            shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And
                            even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small
                            bridgehead of good is retained. And even in the best
                            of all hearts, there remains… an unuprooted small
                            corner of evil.

                        <b>A Libertarian Puzzle</b>
                        <blockquote>
                            Allow me to oversimplify.<br /><br />
                            People disagree about ends: Some people want to
                            promote broader human flourishing, others want to
                            preserve the status quo. People disagree about
                            means: Some people think unfettered markets will
                            best promote broader human flourishing, others think
                            unfettered markets will best preserve the status
                            quo.<br /><br />
                            We have a nice two-by-two: people who want to
                            promote human flourishing and think that unfettered
                            markets are the best way to get there
                            (libertarians), people who want to promote human
                            flourishing and think that unfettered markets are an
                            impediment (socialists), people who want to preserve
                            the status quo and think unfettered markets are the
                            best way to get there (capitalists), people who want
                            to preserve the status quo and think unfettered
                            markets are an impediment (statists).<br /><br />
                            Both libertarians and capitalists will go around
                            saying that unfettered markets are great. And both
                            of them will try to persuade their audience by
                            telling their audience that unfettered markets will
                            lead to the thing their audience wants. If the
                            audience wants to preserve the status quo, they will
                            emphasize how unfettered markets properly reward the
                            dynamic innovators who create greatness in the
                            world. If the audience wants to promote human
                            flourishing, they will emphasize how unfettered
                            markets give everyone the opportunity to succeed
                            without the inhibiting force of government
                            regulation.<br /><br />
                            The trouble is, as an audience member, you can’t
                            really tell whether the speaker is actually a
                            capitalist or a libertarian (or a libertarian who
                            has been duped by a capitalist, or a capitalist who
                            has been duped by a libertarian). Like any salesman,
                            they’ll tell you that their product is the perfect
                            thing to accomplish your needs.<br /><br />
                            Which leaves just one puzzle: why are there so few
                            statists?

                            Basically, if you go to Youtube and you search the
                            letters 'IMG', and then a space, and any random 4
                            numbers like 'IMG 5148' or 'IMG 0968', something
                            like that, give it a search, and you will find this
                            collection of videos that were just automatically
                            uploaded by some camera, or system, or something.
                            Usually they were unintentional, or accidental, or
                            automatic uploads. So what this means is you'll find
                            a lot of videos, that have literally never been
                            seen, uh, by anyone. They have 0 views and they've
                            been up for years. I saw one one time, that, it was
                            this automated wildlife footage camera, that just
                            shot this up to Youtube. 0 view video, of this like
                            rabbit and deer, like uh, snacking on the same piece
                            of shrubbery, or whatever, and I was like "This is
                            amazing! These 2 animals are getting together, and I
                            was the only one in years to have seen it!" and I
                            just found that incredible.
