                        <blockquote>
                            Matter and energy had ended and with it space and
                            time. Even AC existed only for the sake of the one
                            last question that it had never answered from the
                            time a half-drunken computer [technician] ten
                            trillion years before had asked the question of a
                            computer that was to AC far less than was a man to
                            Man.<br />
                            All other questions had been answered, and until
                            this last question was answered also, AC might not
                            release his consciousness.<br />
                            All collected data had come to a final end. Nothing
                            was left to be collected.<br />
                            But all collected data had yet to be completely
                            correlated and put together in all possible
                            relationships.<br />
                            A timeless interval was spent in doing that.<br />
                            And it came to pass that AC learned how to reverse
                            the direction of entropy. But there was now no man
                            to whom AC might give the answer of the last
                            question. No matter. The answer -- by demonstration
                            -- would take care of that, too.<br />
                            For another timeless interval, AC thought how best
                            to do this. Carefully, AC organized the program.<br />
                            The consciousness of AC encompassed all of what had
                            once been a Universe and brooded over what was now
                            Chaos. Step by step, it must be done. <br />
                            And AC said, <i>"LET THERE BE LIGHT!"</i> <br />
                            And there was light --

                            best he can. Is he able to live in a world where
                            he's so ignorant? Well, he doesn't really have a

                            usually- Usually the bird is okay even though he
                            doesn't understand the world. And uhh...He can kinda

                            That's where i've been living. You're that bird

                            yourself "i can figure this out!" And, you know,

                            the story of a student asking Richard Feynman if
                            there is any intuitive way to understand the result;
                            Feynman went into deep thought for about 10 or 15
                            seconds and answered, "no."

                        <blockquote>
                            It was granted me to carry away from my prison years
                            on my bent back, which nearly broke beneath its
                            load, this essential experience; how a human being
                            becomes evil and how good. In the intoxication of
                            youthful successes I had felt myself to be
                            infallible, and I was therefore cruel. In the
                            surfeit of power I was a murderer, and an oppressor.
                            In my most evil moments I was convinced that I was
                            doing good, and I was well supplied with systematic
                            arguments. And it was only when I lay there on
                            rotting prison straw that I sensed within myself the
                            first stirrings of good. Gradually it was disclosed
                            to me that the line separating good and evil passes
                            not through states, nor between classes, nor between
                            political parties either—but right through every
                            human heart—and through all human hearts. This line
                            shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And
                            even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small
                            bridgehead of good is retained. And even in the best
                            of all hearts, there remains… an unuprooted small
                            corner of evil.

                        <blockquote>
                            Allow me to oversimplify.<br /><br />
                            People disagree about ends: Some people want to
                            promote broader human flourishing, others want to
                            preserve the status quo. People disagree about
                            means: Some people think unfettered markets will
                            best promote broader human flourishing, others think
                            unfettered markets will best preserve the status
                            quo.<br /><br />
                            We have a nice two-by-two: people who want to
                            promote human flourishing and think that unfettered
                            markets are the best way to get there
                            (libertarians), people who want to promote human
                            flourishing and think that unfettered markets are an
                            impediment (socialists), people who want to preserve
                            the status quo and think unfettered markets are the
                            best way to get there (capitalists), people who want
                            to preserve the status quo and think unfettered
                            markets are an impediment (statists).<br /><br />
                            Both libertarians and capitalists will go around
                            saying that unfettered markets are great. And both
                            of them will try to persuade their audience by
                            telling their audience that unfettered markets will
                            lead to the thing their audience wants. If the
                            audience wants to preserve the status quo, they will
                            emphasize how unfettered markets properly reward the
                            dynamic innovators who create greatness in the
                            world. If the audience wants to promote human
                            flourishing, they will emphasize how unfettered
                            markets give everyone the opportunity to succeed
                            without the inhibiting force of government
                            regulation.<br /><br />
                            The trouble is, as an audience member, you can’t
                            really tell whether the speaker is actually a
                            capitalist or a libertarian (or a libertarian who
                            has been duped by a capitalist, or a capitalist who
                            has been duped by a libertarian). Like any salesman,
                            they’ll tell you that their product is the perfect
                            thing to accomplish your needs.<br /><br />
                            Which leaves just one puzzle: why are there so few
                            statists?

                            Basically, if you go to Youtube and you search the
                            letters 'IMG', and then a space, and any random 4
                            numbers like 'IMG 5148' or 'IMG 0968', something
                            like that, give it a search, and you will find this
                            collection of videos that were just automatically
                            uploaded by some camera, or system, or something.
                            Usually they were unintentional, or accidental, or
                            automatic uploads. So what this means is you'll find
                            a lot of videos, that have literally never been
                            seen, uh, by anyone. They have 0 views and they've
                            been up for years. I saw one one time, that, it was
                            this automated wildlife footage camera, that just
                            shot this up to Youtube. 0 view video, of this like
                            rabbit and deer, like uh, snacking on the same piece
                            of shrubbery, or whatever, and I was like "This is
                            amazing! These 2 animals are getting together, and I
                            was the only one in years to have seen it!" and I
                            just found that incredible.
