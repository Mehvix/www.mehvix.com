                            thought WOOOOAH! That bird has no idea what he's
                            looking at. And yet, what does the bird do? Does he
                            panic? No...he can't really panic. He just does the
                            best he can. Is he able to live in a world where
                            he's so ignorant? Well, he doesn't really have a
                            choice. Yeah, he can kinda live. It's not- it's
                            usually- Usually the bird is okay even though he
                            doesn't understand the world. And uhh...He can kinda
                            learn what's safe and what's..uh..dangerous. So uh.
                            That's where i've been living. You're that bird
                            looking at the monitor, and you're thinking to
                            yourself "i can figure this out!" And, you know,
                            maybe you have some bird ideas...that are...

                            emphasize how unfettered markets properly reward the
                            dynamic innovators who create greatness in the
                            world. If the audience wants to promote human
                            flourishing, they will emphasize how unfettered
                            markets give everyone the opportunity to succeed
                            without the inhibiting force of government
                            regulation.<br /><br />
                            The trouble is, as an audience member, you can’t
                            really tell whether the speaker is actually a
                            capitalist or a libertarian (or a libertarian who
                            has been duped by a capitalist, or a capitalist who
                            has been duped by a libertarian). Like any salesman,
                            they’ll tell you that their product is the perfect
                            thing to accomplish your needs.<br /><br />
                            Which leaves just one puzzle: why are there so few
                            statists?

                            Basically, if you go to Youtube and you search the
                            letters 'IMG', and then a space, and any random 4
                            numbers like 'IMG 5148' or 'IMG 0968', something
                            like that, give it a search, and you will find this
                            collection of videos that were just automatically
                            uploaded by some camera, or system, or something.
                            Usually they were unintentional, or accidental, or
                            automatic uploads. So what this means is you'll find
                            a lot of videos, that have literally never been
                            seen, uh, by anyone. They have 0 views and they've
                            been up for years. I saw one one time, that, it was
                            this automated wildlife footage camera, that just
                            shot this up to Youtube. 0 view video, of this like
                            rabbit and deer, like uh, snacking on the same piece
                            of shrubbery, or whatever, and I was like "This is
                            amazing! These 2 animals are getting together, and I
                            was the only one in years to have seen it!" and I
                            just found that incredible
