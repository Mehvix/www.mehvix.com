                        <blockquote>
                            The attacks on September the 11th shocked America
                            because no-one had seen them coming. The phrase
                            constantly used was, "We failed to join up the
                            dots." And in the state of fear, the government
                            passed the Patriot Act. It said that everyone's
                            personal data must be open to examination, to stop
                            further attacks. Privacy of the individual now
                            became irrelevant in the face of a much higher need
                            - security. It meant that the very thing that Google
                            had invented, looking for patterns in a mass of
                            data, now became central to the security of the
                            United States. And the threat of new laws to stop
                            Google collecting as much data on people as they
                            wanted faded away. <br />
                            <br />
                            The shock of the attacks of 9/11 began a shift away
                            from the individualism that had been at the centre
                            of America since the 1950s. And Google was going to
                            become central to that shift. Because rather than
                            doing what they had originally dreamed of, giving
                            people data so they could make their own stories,
                            what Google were now doing was TAKING people's data
                            and using it to predict what those individuals would
                            do, without having to ask them anything. <br />
                            <br />
                            What they thought or felt as individuals and the
                            stories they told themselves was completely
                            irrelevant. Consciousness was being sidelined even
                            more.

                            When Deng Xiaoping visited the United States in
                            1979, the actress Shirley MacLaine told him how
                            impressed she had been on a visit to China during

                            ``learn from the peasants.'' The actress said she
                            had been particularly moved by a scholar working in
                            a field, who had described how much more fulfilling

                        <b>Political dissonance</b>
                        <blockquote>
                            The number one motto now about our state of politics
                            is that it's essentially
                            <i>"fake and gay"</i>-- this isn't real. Not just
                            that it's performative, but it's cringe-worthy and
                            connected to a pseudo-reality that's further and
                            further away from what's actually happening. <br />
                            <br />
                            I'll show you this with with this [3D printing gun
                            law]. These people will high-five themselves:
                            <i
                                >"oh we solved kit guns and gun crime in
                                America, right!?"</i
                            >
                            and they'll parade this 100-page solution as some
                            type of you know new-era of peace. But, what do they
                            actually do? They established a new coordinates for
                            the technical and how we will make guns—— because of
                            course we'll continue to make them. And they made me
                            some kind of profit?! Right, now you can only
                            3D-print and CNC-mill receivers. Well god damn! I
                            didn't think i'd be right
                            <i>literally</i> five years later. You know that
                            this is the only way you're going to get it done
                            privately?<br />
                            <br />
                            You see these are two complete camps: these people
                            maybe don't even realize just how starkly they've
                            diverged from what's actually happening. A world of
                            people making guns straight from the internet!<br />

                            I don't just mean TV, I mean this idea that our
                            institutions are somehow even connected to what's
                            happening. The president himself (if not dead,
                            surely dying) zombies on and they aren't even aware
                            of what's happening. The president is a great emblem
                            of the political.<br />
                            <br />And I just want to think, man. I just want to
                            live and and imagine what living would be. And I
                            suppose at this point that means to notice and to
                            think past the political.

                            We will never live in a period when there were no
                            easily accessible peer-review studies for every
                            imaginable thought. There were very simple, very
                            basic instances of life that could set straight
                            every hair on the thinking man's head. And the
                            further we go back in time, the harder it is for me
                            to imagine just how beautiful things could be. I
                            want to know what it's like to not understand a
                            single thing about the universe surrounding; to look
                            at stars in the sky and be absolutely floored by the
                            possibilities. Are they bugs? Are they others like
                            me, lighting fires for warmth? Are they smaller
                            suns? Why does that large white circle turn ever so
                            slightly along with them, all in unison? Are they
                            moving or am I?<br /><br />

                            back. It always comes back. Has to come back.<br /><br />

                        <blockquote>
                            Matter and energy had ended and with it space and
                            time. Even AC existed only for the sake of the one
                            last question that it had never answered from the
                            time a half-drunken computer [technician] ten
                            trillion years before had asked the question of a
                            computer that was to AC far less than was a man to
                            Man.<br />
                            All other questions had been answered, and until
                            this last question was answered also, AC might not
                            release his consciousness.<br />
                            All collected data had come to a final end. Nothing
                            was left to be collected.<br />
                            But all collected data had yet to be completely
                            correlated and put together in all possible
                            relationships.<br />
                            A timeless interval was spent in doing that.<br />
                            And it came to pass that AC learned how to reverse
                            the direction of entropy. But there was now no man
                            to whom AC might give the answer of the last
                            question. No matter. The answer -- by demonstration
                            -- would take care of that, too.<br />
                            For another timeless interval, AC thought how best
                            to do this. Carefully, AC organized the program.<br />
                            The consciousness of AC encompassed all of what had
                            once been a Universe and brooded over what was now
                            Chaos. Step by step, it must be done. <br />
                            And AC said, <i>"LET THERE BE LIGHT!"</i> <br />
                            And there was light --

                            looking at. And yet, what does the bird do? Does he
                            panic? No...he can't really panic. He just does the
                            best he can. Is he able to live in a world where
                            he's so ignorant? Well, he doesn't really have a
                            choice. Yeah, he can kinda live. It's not- it's
                            usually- Usually the bird is okay even though he
                            doesn't understand the world. And uhh...He can kinda
                            learn what's safe and what's..uh..dangerous. So uh.
                            That's where i've been living. You're that bird
                            looking at the monitor, and you're thinking to
                            yourself "i can figure this out!" And, you know,

                        <blockquote>
                            It was granted me to carry away from my prison years
                            on my bent back, which nearly broke beneath its
                            load, this essential experience; how a human being
                            becomes evil and how good. In the intoxication of
                            youthful successes I had felt myself to be
                            infallible, and I was therefore cruel. In the
                            surfeit of power I was a murderer, and an oppressor.
                            In my most evil moments I was convinced that I was
                            doing good, and I was well supplied with systematic
                            arguments. And it was only when I lay there on
                            rotting prison straw that I sensed within myself the
                            first stirrings of good. Gradually it was disclosed
                            to me that the line separating good and evil passes
                            not through states, nor between classes, nor between
                            political parties either—but right through every
                            human heart—and through all human hearts. This line
                            shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And
                            even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small
                            bridgehead of good is retained. And even in the best
                            of all hearts, there remains… an unuprooted small
                            corner of evil.

                            to preserve the status quo and think unfettered
                            markets are an impediment (statists).<br /><br />
                            Both libertarians and capitalists will go around
                            saying that unfettered markets are great. And both
                            of them will try to persuade their audience by
                            telling their audience that unfettered markets will
                            lead to the thing their audience wants. If the
                            audience wants to preserve the status quo, they will
                            emphasize how unfettered markets properly reward the
                            dynamic innovators who create greatness in the
                            world. If the audience wants to promote human
                            flourishing, they will emphasize how unfettered
                            markets give everyone the opportunity to succeed
                            without the inhibiting force of government
                            regulation.<br /><br />
                            The trouble is, as an audience member, you can’t
                            really tell whether the speaker is actually a
                            capitalist or a libertarian (or a libertarian who
                            has been duped by a capitalist, or a capitalist who
                            has been duped by a libertarian). Like any salesman,
                            they’ll tell you that their product is the perfect
                            thing to accomplish your needs.<br /><br />
                            Which leaves just one puzzle: why are there so few
                            statists?

                            Basically, if you go to Youtube and you search the
                            letters 'IMG', and then a space, and any random 4
                            numbers like 'IMG 5148' or 'IMG 0968', something
                            like that, give it a search, and you will find this
                            collection of videos that were just automatically
                            uploaded by some camera, or system, or something.
                            Usually they were unintentional, or accidental, or
                            automatic uploads. So what this means is you'll find
                            a lot of videos, that have literally never been
                            seen, uh, by anyone. They have 0 views and they've
                            been up for years. I saw one one time, that, it was
                            this automated wildlife footage camera, that just
                            shot this up to Youtube. 0 view video, of this like
                            rabbit and deer, like uh, snacking on the same piece
                            of shrubbery, or whatever, and I was like "This is
                            amazing! These 2 animals are getting together, and I
                            was the only one in years to have seen it!" and I
                            just found that incredible.
