        <article>
            <p>This blog goes over how to instal CalyxOS — a custom Android ROM for (somewhat ironically) Google's Pixel
                phones. It's built with "Privacy by Design"; minimizing tracking done by phone manufactureres, cell
                providers, ISPs, advertising companies, etc. That being said, it's not as extreme as alternatives,
                notably <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a>, and seeks to maintain a balance between
                usability and privacy. You can check (and contribute) app compatability <a

            <h1>Backup</h1>
            <p>You will loose all of your data so backup stuff you want to keep. You won't be using Google to
                backup/restore once you get CalyxOS installed, so you're best bet is probably to transfer files directly
                to your computer. You can do so by enabling "Data Transfer through USB" so your files can be viewed &
                copied from your PC File Explorer.
            </p>

            <h1>Unlock Bootloader</h1>
            <p>Go into your device's settings, <code>About phone</code>, and down to <code>Build number</code>. Spam the
                button 10 times until you get developer. Then, go back and to <code>System</code> >
                <code>Advanced</code> > <code>Developer options</code> and enable <code>USB debugging</code> and
                <code>OEM unlocking</code>
            </p>

            <h1>Update Drivers</h1>
            <p>Download the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb">Google USB Drivers</a> and
                extract the files somewhere on your PC. Then, showdown the phone, press and hold the power and volume
                down until the bootloader (black screen with a red triangle) appears. You can then connect the phone to
                your PC if you haven't already and go to Device Manager in Windows. Then, navigate to
                <code>Other Devices</code>, find your phone, right-click, and go to <code>Update drivers</code> >
                <code>Browse...</code> > point to where you extract the USB drivers, and Windows should do the rest.
            </p>


            <h1>Flash CalyxOS</h1>
            <p>Create a new folder and download the <a href="https://calyxos.org/get">CalyxOS release for your
                    device</a> (don't unzip it though!) as well as the <a
                    href="https://github.com/AOSPAlliance/device-flasher/releases/">device flasher</a> (which may be
                falsesly flagged as a virus). From there, you can run the <code>device-flasher.exe</code> and follow
                along the instructions. If you've followed the steps this far, the only step not done is to remove the
                SIM card. Once you hit enter to begin the flash, you can just sit back and wait for it to install. Once
                it has, all you have to do is re-lock the bootloader and you're set!
