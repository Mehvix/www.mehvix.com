            <p>
                Merry Christmas all. Earlier this winter break I was talking with my <a href="https://www.afmoriarty.com/">pal</a> about why I give a damn
                about privacy, why I believe it is crucial to Being. It boils down to this: <b>the alternative to
                    privacy is </b>
                <sc>orthodoxy</sc>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary ways in which we interact with the world are increasingly dependent on the web — from
                contacting and
                maintaining connections with friends, to consuming news and entertainment (more generally, sharing and
                accessing information).
            </p>
            <p>
                I hold that we can be thought of as the sum of our actions.
                This is to say, our digital presence/interactions reflect us;
                one's online behavior is inextricably linked to one's self.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, <i>not</i> when you are spied on—but simply when you believe you could be under observation—you
                behave differently (and importantly this often occurs at a subconsciously level).
                So when you're using an online service that's routinely not respected its users' privacy,
                your actions are no longer a product of autonomy; rather,
                are shaped by the expectations imposed upon you — <sc>orthodoxy</sc>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Under this environment, the world appears more dim.
                One becomes less receptive, less imaginative, to the vast
                possibilities of the world and what it
                could be;
                less willing to question as a critic, subjugating oneself to what is;
                less able to change the mind of yourself and of those around you.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is why every tyrant has
                desired/imposed
                surveillance — it squishes dissent (free, possibly opposing thought) before it can form. When you
                <i>won't</i> do things
                (when you self-censor) you become myopic, submitting to that which is set before you.
                What limits does society steer you towards or away from?<sup>1</sup> This answer is only revealed with
                hindsight.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is also why I believe privacy fear mongering—the absolute pessimism perspective—that no matter what
                you do, 'they' can comprise anyone<sup>2</sup>—is wholly unproductive. It is a
                self-fulfilling prophecy: if you are sure you are powerless, then you become powerless.<sup>3</sup> Any
                fool can construct a scenario where nothing matters.
            </p>

                <sup>1</sup> I'll point to gay marriage as stance outside of the realm of public acceptability that is
                now widely supported (in the states).
                <br>
                <sup>2</sup> Privacy pessimist FUD asserts that all hope is
                lost, say the feds have a backdoor to the CPU (see, <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/sysadmin/the-management-engine-an-attack-on-computer-users-freedom">Intel
                    Management Engine</a>) or have
                already cracked modern encryption standards.
                I am all for bringing awareness to possible attack vectors or worst-case scenarios, but be realistic.
                Delusions and paranoia aren't at all useful.
                <br>
                <sup>3</sup> Adam Curtis' <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13973190/">Can't Get You Out of My
                        Head</a></i> makes a similar case with respect to conspiracy theories and their ability to erode
                hope, one's drive to act.
