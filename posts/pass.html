                    After this blog post goes up, I am taking down
                    pass.mehvix.com. But, given the nature of open source code,

                    It was a good run- I started pass for myself and roomies,
                    then they told five people, and those people told five more,
                    etc etc until it came full loop where people would tell me
                    about pass.mehvix.com not knowing that I was mehvix.

                    Try and see if you can infer when lunch and dinner are based
                    on the spikes. Also, don't worry if you've used pass and are
                    concerned about your privacy: I'm a privacy nut and have
                    never collected any user information.

                    PS to UCB- If I can circumvent your "campus safety feature"
                    in five minutes and you don't realize for two months, then
                    maybe (just maybe!) it's an issue with the campus safety
                    feature itself 🤔🤔. Also, how am I supposed to get food?
                    I'm paying you guys for a meal plan that I cannot use
                    because I cannot get into the dining halls because your app
                    doesn't work:
