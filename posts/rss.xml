                    After this blog post goes up, I am taking down
                    pass.mehvix.com. But, given the nature of open source code,

			<title>Tiling Distance Contradiction</title>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>
                    This past weekend I was walking around downtown Berkeley
                    with my friends to get
                    <i><a href=&quot;http://www.kingpindonuts.com/&quot;>Kingpin Donuts</a></i>
                    when I thought of this contradiction involving the quickest
                    way to traverses a square with infinitely small street
                    blocks street blocks.
                </p>
<h1>Problem</h1>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>
                    Consider a <code>1 x 1</code> unit square and a particle
                    starting at the bottom left of the square:
                    <code>(0,0)</code>. This particle wants to move to
                    <code>(1,1)</code>
                    [top right] as quickly as possible while moving only along
                    the edges [streets] of the square. In the
                    <code>1 x 1</code> case, you have two paths each involving
                    two steps: (1) up, right and (2) right, up. Since these
                    paths are symmetric, we'll treat them as a single path. In
                    this single path, we clearly travel a distance of
                    <code>2 units</code> [<code>1 unit per step</code> and
                    <code>2 steps</code>].
                </p>
<h2>Smaller Blocks</h2>
<p>
                    Now, what if we divide our existing block into forths; that
                    is, we have four <code>0.5 x 0.5</code> unit squares. Now,
                    consider the following two paths that each take four steps:
                    (1) right, right, up, up and (2) right, up, right, up. Just
                    as the previous <code>1 x 1</code> case, both of these paths
                    travel a total distance of <code>2 units</code> [each of the
                    four steps travels <code>0.5 units</code>].
                </p>
<p>
                    Say we repeat this dividing of the square
                    <code>n</code> times so our original <code>1 x 1</code> unit
                    block is split into <code>2^n x 2^n</code> sub-blocks, each
                    with side length <code>1/2^n</code>. Now both the outermost
                    and alternating paths each take <code>2 * 2^n</code> steps:
                    (1) right <code>2^n</code> times followed by up
                    <code>2^n</code> more times and (2) right, up
                    <code>2^n</code> times. Again, both travel a total distance
                    of <code>2 units</code> for all <code>n &gt; 0</code>.
                </p>
<h2>Contradiction</h2>
<p>
                    However, as we take <code>n</code> to infinity the
                    alternating path looks more and more like particle is
                    travelling along the hypotenuse line from
                    <code>(0,0)</code> to <code>(1,1)</code>. But, we know that
                    the distance traveled is always <code>2 units</code>. How
                    can this be if the particle is travelling along the distance
                    of the hypotenuse which has a distances of
                    <code>√2 units</code>?!
                </p>
<h1>Explanation</h1>
<p>
                    This contradiction stumped me for a bit, but I thought of
                    three different ways to explain this seeming contradiction
                    while showering last night.
                </p>
<h2>1: Kinematics</h2>
<p>
                    We know that the particle takes a total of
                    <code>2 * n^2</code> steps, each of which are at a constant
                    speed [lets say <code>1 unit/second</code>]. In the original
                    <code>1 x 1</code> case, we travel <code>2 units </code> so
                    we take <code>2 seconds</code>. In each following case, we
                    take just as long since both the speed and distance are
                    constant so we know that the time we travel is constantly
                    <code>2 seconds</code>. Therefore, in the
                    <code>2^n x 2^n</code> sub-blocks case, since we know that
                    we're traveling at a constant <code>1 unit/sec</code> and
                    taking <code>2 seconds</code> meaning we're traveling
                    <code>2 units</code>.
                </p>
<p>
                    If we watched this scenario play out, we would see the
                    particle appearing to move at a speed of
                    <code>1/√2 units/sec</code>. That is, even though the line
                    <i>looks</i> like the hypotenuse, it isn't. This makes sense
                    because we cannot travel along the hypotenuse, no matter how
                    small we get: At the very beginning we said the particle can
                    only move along the edges [streets] of the square, meaning
                    only travel right and up. So when we see the particle travel
                    along the hypotenuse at <code>1/√2 units/sec</code>, we're
                    actually seeing the particle move right and up [or up and
                    right] a tiny amount that we only <i>assume</i> to be along
                    the hypotenuse.
                </p>
<p>
                    Again, the time staying constant because our speed and
                    distance stay the same: we keep moving
                    <code>1 unit/sec</code> and we travel a distance [2 for
                    up/right] * [paths] * [distance/path] =
                    <code>2 * 2^n * 1/2^n = 2</code> so we take
                    <code>2 seconds</code> to traverse the grid even as we push
                    <code>n</code> to infinity.
                </p>
<h2>2: Additive</h2>
<p>
                    Instead of dividing the square into sub-squares, what if we
                    tiled instead so that we doubled each existing square. That
                    is, we'd start with a single <code>1 x 1</code> unit block,
                    then grow to <code>2 x 2, 4 x 4, 8 x 8, ...</code> etc.
                    However, while we exponentially increase perimeter, we'll
                    also increased our speed proportionally [starting at
                    <code>1</code> unit/sec, then
                    <code>2, 4, 8, ...</code> units/sec]. That way, the particle
                    will always take 2 seconds to complete the square.
                </p>
<p>
                    In addition to seeing that this 2 seconds is a constant for
                    any resolution, we can also see that the two steps of both
                    right and up movements are finite distances. That means that
                    both the up and right movements are not, and cannot ever, be
                    treated as a single move diagonally [this is what we
                    implicitly assumed was happening when the sub-square sides
                    were of length
                    <code>1/2^n x 1/2^n</code>].
                </p>
<h2>3: Limit</h2>
<p>
                    Adding on to the explanation involving tiling above, we can
                    write an equation to relate the total distance traveled
                    [units] per speed [in units/sec]: <code>2n/n</code>. With
                    this, we can take the limit of <code>n</code> to infinity
                    and clearly this ends up as <code>2</code>. This result has
                    the units <code>seconds</code> which is consistent with our
                    other for the particle to travel all paths.
                </p>
<h1>What does this mean and what are the limits?</h1>
<p>
                    With that being said, this seems to say that travelling
                    eight blocks east and eight blocks north should take the
                    same time as travelling east then north eight times (eight
                    is arbitrary).
                </p>
<p>
                    In the real world, this isn't often true<sup><a href=&quot;#1-ref&quot; id=&quot;1-exp&quot;>1</a></sup>. Blocks aren't perfect rectangles made from streets and
                    your steps are rarely parallel/orthogonal to the x/y axis
                    so, unlike the idealized example, you're rarely moving in
                    just the x or y direction at a single time. Regardless, I
                    still think it's an interesting thought puzzle of sorts.
                </p>

<p>
                    Okay so for the past month I wasted a lot of my time
                    (binging
                    <a href=&quot;//yewtu.be/channel/UCYwVxWpjeKFWwu8TML-Te9A&quot;>JCS</a>, playing
                    <a href=&quot;//store.steampowered.com/app/629760/MORDHAU/&quot;>Mordhau</a>, doomscrolling) and I think writing out my general summer
                    goals will be helpful for a couple reasons: (1) even though
                    few people I know read this blog, I hope I'll feel some
                    amount of accountability to follow through, (2) when people
                    ask me what I'm doing I hope to not give ad-hoc answers, (3)
                    I think writing in general makes me think more deeply about
                    the content, and I want to think more deeply about my goals
                    and (4) I think it'll be interesting to look back this in
                    the fall and beyond.
                </p>
<h1>Chess</h1>
<p>
                    I've been split between trying to improve at either Age of
                    Empires II, Poker, or Chess. AoE is stressful to play and I
                    don't want to ruin the childhood nostalgia I have for it.
                    They're also releasing co-op campaigns and I think that'll
                    be more fun than 1v1 Arabia wars. As for Poker, I enjoy it
                    in-person with friends but I'd suspect none of my friends
                    would want to grind it as much as I would want to this
                    summer, leaving only online. While crypto has revived online
                    to some degree, I think it's hard to improve online because
                    you tend not to play with the same people and you don't have
                    the fun of in-person tells. Also I don't want to go broke.
                </p>
<p>
                    That leaves Chess, which is probably my weakest of the
                    three. I'm not really sure where to start right now. This
                    past week I've been working through puzzles on LiChess, but
                    I don't think I have a (strong) foundation. I know control
                    middle, don't fuck up your pawn structure, and don't do
                    <a href=&quot;//youtu.be/e91M0XLX7Jw&quot;>this</a>. I've got
                    <a href=&quot;//www.masterclass.com/classes/garry-kasparov-teaches-chess&quot;>Kasparov's Masterclass</a>
                    downloaded which I may binge through to get a sense of where
                    to start. I've also got friends who already play and are
                    very good (at least seem very good to me, probably how I
                    seem 'good' at AoE to them) so maybe I can get some
                    coaching.
                </p>
<h1>Friends</h1>
<p>
                    It didn't hit me that
                    <i>&quot;wow I'm not going to see most of my classmates ever
                        again&quot;</i>
                    until maybe a week after graduation. And I'm still now sure
                    how I feel about that. Asking my self
                    <i>
                        &quot;how do I want to spend my last summer where I will have
                        the least number of responsibilities&quot;
                    </i>
                    was a wake-up call to spend more time in-person with my
                    friends (especially compared to spending time pubbing TF2 or
                    binging Sopranos a third time). And to be realistic, I
                    probably won't keep in touch with 80% of them after freshmen
                    year – when I began to focus on academics and robotics
                    Sophomore year, I only kept in touch with maybe three main
                    friends (and that was when I would see my main friend group
                    nearly every day).

<a href=&quot;//artofproblemsolving.com/community/c1080751h2594496&quot;>David and I have been hiking twice this week</a>
                    which has been fun (and I can sub in hiking for running in
                    my workout, I hate running). I've been using
                    <a href=&quot;//www.alltrails.com/&quot;>AllTrails</a> which has a big
                    enough userbase near Madison that there are fairly accurate
                    and up-to-date reviews and statistics of nearby places.
                    Maybe I'll make a post later once we hit all the nearby
                    places summarizing my thoughts. Also, Aidan's getting back
                    from rowing competitions next week so I'm hoping we can wrap
                    up our Pathfinder game and go fishing with the fellas like
                    last summer.
                </p>
<h1>Read</h1>
<p>
                    I haven't read for the sake of reading in a long time. It's
                    gotten to the point where I have a que of books that I've
                    asked for over the years just sitting on my shelf. Two years
                    back, I started scheduling my day down to the 15-minute mark
                    and I think I've never given my self the opportunity to sit
                    down for an extended period of time and read. It's crazy to
                    think that I read as much as I did when I did those library
                    summer reading programs (Now that I think of it, I was so
                    cool that I used to do two library's reading programs at
                    once).
                </p>
<p>
                    Anyways, last week I started
                    <a href=&quot;//www.goodreads.com/book/show/113537.Positively_Fifth_Street&quot;>Positively Fifth Street</a>
                    and I have
                    <a href=&quot;//www.goodreads.com/book/show/662.Atlas_Shrugged&quot;>Atlas Shrugged</a>,
                    <a href=&quot;//www.goodreads.com/book/show/45363333-harassment-architecture&quot;>Harassment Architecture</a>, and
                    <a href=&quot;//www.goodreads.com/book/show/135479.Cat_s_Cradle&quot;>Cat's Cradle</a>
                    ready on my bookshelf. Using
                    <a href=&quot;http://wordcounters.com&quot;>this site</a> to figure
                    out word counts, it's around 500,000 words in all (for what
                    it's worth, Rand's work is 327k). Lets say I can read 250
                    words a minute and I have six weeks left of summer. Doing
                    the math, I need to read about an hour a day. I know I do
                    anything best when I'm in
                    <a href=&quot;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)&quot;>flow</a>, so I think I'll try and read my seven hours in two
                    sessions each week. I don't want to schedule reading down to
                    the hour, rather just set the expectation of
                    <i>&quot;I'm going to read this afternoon&quot;</i> so I avoid
                    overloading my mind during those sessions.
                </p>
<h1>Don't 'Learn', Do Projects</h1>
<p>
                    This may just be me, but I do not enjoy learning all the
                    nuances behind learning a programming language. I like
                    diving in head first. I learned my first language, Python,
                    by dicking around with
                    <a href=&quot;//github.com/Rapptz/discord.py&quot;>discord.py</a>
                    and building a
                    <a href=&quot;//github.com/mehvix/synapsbot-rw&quot;>Discord bot</a>
                    my freshmen summer. I doubt that I wouldn't have learned
                    nearly as much compared to if I had followed a course.
                    That's not to say that courses don't have good content, I
                    would've gotten bored.
                </p>
<p>
                    For example: Two weeks ago I tried learning C++ from the
                    start with
                    <a href=&quot;http://learncpp.com&quot;>learncpp.com</a> and it was
                    tedious. Nothing against the site, but it a time sink
                    because I'd have to go page after page skimming past stuff I
                    already knew while trying to pick out what knowledge I
                    didn't already know. Compare this to me learning Ruby a
                    month ago when I threw together an
                    <a href=&quot;//github.com/Mehvix/aops-blog-rss&quot;>RSS generator for AoPS</a>
                    : I learned all sorts of stuff not only about Ruby, but also
                    about Heroku and the steps behind getting code from my PC to
                    a server.
                </p>
<p>
                    That being said, while I've got a huuuge backload of
                    projects in my
                    <a href=&quot;/todo.html&quot;>todo list</a> I honestly have lost the
                    spark-of-interest I previously had for most of them.
                    Throughout this summer, I don't want to force myself to work
                    on something I'm not actively interested in. Rather, I want
                    to work on projects spontaneously when ideas come to me –
                    that's when I learn most. After all, I'll have at least four
                    years to formally learn information and follow class
                    projects :p.
                </p>

<p>
                    Hey math monke(s), do you use
                    <a href=&quot;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS&quot;>RSS</a> (bonus if you
                    are cool enough to have a
                    <a href=&quot;http://cloud.mehvix.com&quot;>cloud.mehvix.com</a>
                    account and use the
                    <a href=&quot;//apps.nextcloud.com/apps/news&quot;>News app</a>) and
                    read AoPS blogs? If so, you should checkout
                    <a href=&quot;http://aops-rss.mehvix.com&quot;>aops-rss.mehvix.com</a>
                    — plug in a blog's URL like
                    <a href=&quot;//artofproblemsolving.com/community/c1273888&quot;>Dan's</a>
                    (kiss_mm) and it should spit out a
                    <a href=&quot;//aops-rss.herokuapp.com/1273888&quot;>RSS feed</a>.
                    Prior to this project, I haven't used Ruby so there may be
                    kinks and edge case errors — if you run into any,
                    <a href=&quot;//github.com/Mehvix/aops-blog-rss/issues&quot;>create an issue on Github</a>
                    or reach out :)
                </p>
<p>
                    If you haven't heard of RSS, you should check it out. In
                    essence, it lets you keep up with online feeds (blogs /
                    forums posts, news sites, podcasts,
                    <a href=&quot;//www.comicsrss.com/rss/calvinandhobbes.rss&quot;>Calvin and Hobbes</a>, etc.) without having to manually check webpages for
                    updates. I'd recommend using
                    <a href=&quot;//chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-rss-feed-url/kfghpdldaipanmkhfpdcjglncmilendn&quot;>this extension</a>
                    for Chrome-based browsers to see if a site has an RSS feed.
                    Plus, with <a href=&quot;//nitter.net/&quot;>Nitter</a> and
                    <a href=&quot;//bibliogram.art/&quot;>Bibliogram</a> you can create
                    proxied RSS feeds for Twitter and Instagram accounts so you
                    don't have to deal with the bullshit spying + ads. If you
                    don't have a
                    <a href=&quot;//cloud.mehvix.com&quot;>cloud.mehvix.com</a>
                    account, there's lots of RSS Readers out there. I've heard
                    alright things about
                    <a href=&quot;//feedly.com/&quot;>Feedly</a> and
                    <a href=&quot;//www.newsblur.com/&quot;>NewsBlur</a> but do your own
                    due diligence.

			<title>Webmonkeys: Use www</title>

<p>
                    I have a <i>yuuuug</i> bookmarks folder of assorted articles
                    I've come across but haven't had the time to delve into. Now
                    that I'm through my UW classwork I've finally been able to
                    chunk through some of them and today and I came across the
                    (mostly-irrelevant, website-related decision) debate between
                    <a href=&quot;http://no-www.org/&quot;>no-www</a> and
                    <a href=&quot;//www.yes-www.org/&quot;><b>www</b>.yes-www</a>.
                </p>
<h1>The debate</h1>
<p>
                    The argument by <a href=&quot;http://no-www.org/&quot;>no-www</a> is
                    that <code>www</code> is supposedly “deprecated” in that
                    it's redundant to type. But, if you look at our tech
                    overlords like <a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;>Google</a>,
                    <a href=&quot;http://amazon.com&quot;>Amazon</a>,
                    <a href=&quot;http://apple.com&quot;>Apple</a>, etc. you'll see that
                    they redirect no-www to www (more on why later). For what
                    it's worth though, having no <code>www</code> has its
                    <i>minimalism aesthetic</i> and anecdotally most smaller
                    sites seem to have no www.
                </p>
<p>
<a href=&quot;//www.yes-www.org/&quot;>yes-www</a>
                    has actual
                    <a href=&quot;//www.yes-www.org/why-use-www/&quot;>technical arguments</a>: (1) you can’t use a CNAME record on a &quot;naked domain&quot;
                    (that is, sites with no <code>www</code>) and (2) cookies on
                    the naked domain get sent to all subdomains (so all
                    <code>*.mehvix.com</code> domains) which can mess up caching
                    for static files.
                </p>
<h1>Changing</h1>
<p>
                    Both of the pro-<code>www</code> points aren't an issue for
                    me now, but best not to limit myself later down the line. To
                    swap, I prefaced the domain with <code>www</code> on this
                    site's
                    <a href=&quot;//github.com/Mehvix/mehvix.com/commit/037e1dde90bc5a4e43adfe72dfeeb0e49d73d898&quot;>CNAME on the GitHub</a>
                    , changed my <code>CNAME</code> and <code>A</code> DNS
                    records so that all prior non-<code>www</code> links would
                    go to the new <code>www</code> version.

			<title>Windows: Your files are insecure</title>

			<link>https://mehvix.com/posts/win-insecure-files.html</link>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<article>
<p>
                    Anyone who has physical access to your Windows machine can
                    plug in and boot to a live USB drive which allows them to
                    see/edit/copy your entire filesystem — all images,
                    documents, applications, etc. — without logging in. All this
                    can be prevented by just encrypting your file system.
                </p>
<h1>BitLocker</h1>
<p>
                    Microsoft doesn't value your security. Their proprietary
                    encryption software
                    <a href=&quot;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitLocker&quot;>BitLocker</a>
                    is only available for paying Windows Pro and Enterprise
                    users (and even then, it isn't enabled by default 🤔). And,
                    if for some reason you're paying (extra) for Windows, you
                    still shouldn't use BitLocker. Microsoft practice
                    <a href=&quot;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity&quot;>security through obscurity</a>: like Windows, BitLocker code is proprietary meaning
                    there's no way to vet it's security or verify there are not
                    backdoors for any of the
                    <a href=&quot;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_agencies#Modern_era&quot;>alphabet boys</a>
                    which Microsoft has done before — from what's been made
                    <i>public</i>, Microsoft has
                    <a href=&quot;//archive.ph/Y3hsk&quot;>helped the NSA to circumvent their own encryption</a>,
                    <a href=&quot;//archive.ph/ETUkp&quot;>backdoored pre-installed disk encryption</a>,
                    <a href=&quot;//archive.ph/sX5dY&quot;>informed the NSA of bugs in Windows before fixing
                        them</a>, and
                    <a href=&quot;//archive.is/ZW77o&quot;>there's a secret NSA key in Windows, whose functions we
                        don't know</a>.
                </p>
<p>
                    The alternative to proprietary software is open source
                    software: anyone can verify an open source project's
                    legitimacy and contribute improvements of their own. For
                    Windows, the open source encryption software I'd recommend
                    is
                    <a href=&quot;//veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html&quot;>VeraCrypt</a>.
                </p>
<h1>VeraCrypt</h1>
<p>
                    You can download the latest installer of VeraCrypt
                    <a href=&quot;//veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html&quot;>here</a>. Once
                    you install it, the process of encrypting your drive(s) is
                    fairly trivial. For encrypting your storage device with the
                    operating system, you start by going selecting
                    <code>System</code> &gt;
                    <code>Encrypt System Partition/Drive...</code> and following
                    the creation wizard. The default AES + SHA-512 is more than
                    enough. Once you get to &quot;Collecting Random Data&quot;, shake your
                    mouse around — VeraCrypt gathers random data from your
                    mouse's position because (somewhat unintuitively)
                    <a href=&quot;//www.howtogeek.com/183051/htg-explains-how-computers-generate-random-numbers/&quot;>it's hard for computers to generate unpredictable
                        random numbers on their own</a>.

                    Later, when prompted to, I'd recommend that you create a
                    rescue disk — this is allows you to unlock your drive if one
                    day Windows can't boot or the VeraCrypt bootloader get
                    damaged (unlikely, but possible). All you have to do is grab
                    a USB drive, create a folder called <code>EFI</code>, and
                    add copy the generated Rescue Disk. If something ever does
                    go wrong and you want to decrypt your drive outside of
                    Windows, all you have to do is plug in and boot to the USB
                    then enter your decryption password. Because you still need
                    to have your password, you don't need to keep this USB
                    especially secure (but hey, it can't hurt!).
                </p>
<h2>Wiping</h2>
<p>
                    You'll also be able to optionally write wipe the drive of
                    all unencrypted data from the drive. Multiple passes is an
                    <a href=&quot;http://www.infosecisland.com/blogview/16130-The-Urban-Legend-of-Multipass-Hard-Disk-Overwrite.html&quot;>urban legend</a>
                    (doesn't improve security), wears the drives down, and can
                    take a very long time. One pass is sufficient and doesn't
                    take too long (compared to no passes).
                </p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>
                    After selecting the number of passes, you should be prompted
                    to test that the boot loader works before VeraCrypt proceeds
                    with encryption and the wipe(s). Once you restart, you'll be
                    be prompted with the VeraCrypt boot loader before the
                    Windows login screen. Here, you enter your password (and pin
                    if you opted for one; if you didn't leave it empty). Once
                    you get back into Windows, VeraCrypt will open and prompt
                    you to actually encrypt your data and fulfill the wipe(s).
                    When that completes, you're done!

			<title>CalyxOS Install Guide</title>

<p>
                    This blog goes over how to install CalyxOS — a custom
                    Android ROM for (somewhat ironically) Google's Pixel phones.
                    It's built with &quot;Privacy by Design&quot;; minimizing tracking
                    done by phone manufacturers, cell providers, ISPs,
                    advertising companies, etc. That being said, it's not as
                    extreme as alternatives, notably
                    <a href=&quot;//grapheneos.org/&quot;>GrapheneOS</a>, and seeks
                    to maintain a balance between usability and privacy. You can
                    check (and contribute) app compatibility
                    <a href=&quot;//plexus.techlore.tech/&quot;>here</a>.
                </p>
                ---

                <h1>Backup</h1>
<p>
                    You will loose all of your data so backup stuff you want to
                    keep. You won't be using Google to backup/restore once you
                    get CalyxOS installed, so you're best bet is probably to
                    transfer files directly to your computer. You can do so by
                    enabling &quot;Data Transfer through USB&quot; so your files can be
                    viewed &amp; copied from your PC File Explorer.
                </p>
<h1>Unlock Bootloader</h1>
<p>
                    Go into your device's settings, <code>About phone</code>,
                    and down to <code>Build number</code>. Spam the button 10
                    times until you get developer. Then, go back and to
                    <code>System</code> &gt; <code>Advanced</code> &gt;
                    <code>Developer options</code> and enable
                    <code>USB debugging</code> and
                    <code>OEM unlocking</code>
</p>
<h1>Update Drivers</h1>
<p>
                    Download the
                    <a href=&quot;//developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb&quot;>Google USB Drivers</a>
                    and extract the files somewhere on your PC. Then, showdown
                    the phone, press and hold the power and volume down until
                    the bootloader (black screen with a red triangle) appears.
                    You can then connect the phone to your PC if you haven't
                    already and go to Device Manager in Windows. Then, navigate
                    to <code>Other Devices</code>, find your phone, right-click,
                    and go to <code>Update drivers</code> &gt;
                    <code>Browse...</code> &gt; point to where you extract the USB
                    drivers, and Windows should do the rest.
                </p>
<h1>Flash CalyxOS</h1>
<p>
                    Create a new folder and download the
                    <a href=&quot;//calyxos.org/get&quot;>CalyxOS release for your device</a>
                    (don't unzip it though!) as well as the
                    <a href=&quot;//github.com/AOSPAlliance/device-flasher/releases/&quot;>device flasher</a>
                    (which may be falsely flagged as a virus). From there, you
                    can run the
                    <code>device-flasher.exe</code> and follow along the
                    instructions. If you've followed the steps this far, the
                    only step not done is to remove the SIM card. Once you hit
                    enter to begin the flash, you can just sit back and wait for
                    it to install. Once it has, all you have to do is re-lock
                    the bootloader and you're set!
                </p>
<h1>Next</h1>
<p>
                If you need help with CalyxOS I'd recommend asking any through
                any of the following services:
                <table>
<ul>
<li>
                            Matrix:
                            <a href=&quot;//matrix.to/#/#CalyxOS:matrix.org&quot;>#CalyxOS:matrix.org</a>
</li>
<li>
                            IRC:
                            <a href=&quot;//webchat.freenode.net/#calyxos&quot;>#calyxos</a>
                            on Freenode
                        </li>
<li>
                            Telegram:

</li>
<li>Reddit: <a href=&quot;//old.reddit.com/r/CalyxOS/&quot;>/r/CalyxOS</a></li>
</ul>
</table>
                All of the chat rooms are bridged so messages sent on one will show up on others and vice versa.
                </p>
<p>
                    Last, there's an
                    <a href=&quot;//calyxos.org/news/&quot;>blog</a> for updates +
                    known bugs (and fixes) that's got an
                    <a href=&quot;//calyxos.org/feed.xml&quot;>RSS feed</a> too.

			<title>Make Twitter Suck Less</title>

<p>
                    Twitter is pretty bad. But, it's the only place with
                    <a href=&quot;//twitter.com/jon_bois&quot;>Jon Bois tweets</a>. Here
                    are a couple ways you can make Twitter suck less.
                </p>
<p>
<i>2/2/2021 Update:</i> I came across
                    <a href=&quot;//github.com/zedeus/nitter&quot;>nitter</a> which is a
                    FOSS proxy to Twitter. Currently, you can only view certain
                    profiles but is perfect for my use-case.
                </p>

                ---
                <div>
<h1 style=&quot;margin-top: 1em&quot;>Remove Homepage Crap</h1>
                    The Twitter &quot;What's Happening&quot; sidebar is dedicated to drama
                    and stuff intended to make you angry. To remove this, you'll
                    need
                    <a href=&quot;//github.com/gorhill/uBlock&quot;>uBlock origin</a>
                    (which is something you should have installed if you want a
                    more suck less internet in general). Once you have it
                    installed, go to the
                    <a href=&quot;chrome-extension://cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm/dashboard.html&quot;>dashboard</a>
                    add the following under the &quot;My filters&quot; tab:
                    <pre><code class=&quot;css&quot;>twitter.com##.r-1hycxz.r-zso239.r-aqfbo4.css-1dbjc4n</code></pre>
</div>
<div>
<h1>De-numerate</h1>
                    As
                    <a href=&quot;//bengrosser.com/projects/twitter-demetricator/&quot;>Ben Grosser</a>
                    writes:
                    <blockquote>
                        Visible metrics can make us feel more compulsive,
                        competitive, and anxious. Further—without realizing it,
                        we craft rules for ourselves based on what the numbers
                        say, and these rules affect what we post, who we friend,
                        and which posts we “like.”
                    </blockquote>

                    He's written a tool to remove all metrics (likes, retweets,
                    replies, followers, etc.) which you can install through one
                    sources
                    <a href=&quot;//bengrosser.com/projects/twitter-demetricator/install-twitter-demetricator/&quot;>linked here</a>. I am personally using
                    <a href=&quot;//github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey&quot;>Violentmonkey</a>.
                </div>
<div>
<h1>Remove Interests</h1>
                    Twitter keeps track of what it think is you're interesting
                    in, then uses it to show you &quot;relevant&quot; tweets (and ads).
                    You can manually prune these
                    <a href=&quot;//twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data/twitter_interests&quot;>here</a>, but the list can get very long, very quick. You can
                    automate &quot;un-interesting&quot; all topics by pasting
                    <a href=&quot;//gist.github.com/edjw/61cda68535b237fa7fa8db23842c1b6d/&quot;>Ed Johnson-Williams'</a>
                    script in console:

                    <pre><code class=&quot;js&quot;>&quot;use strict;&quot;
var labelSelector = &quot;.r-1p0dtai.r-1ei5mc7.r-1pi2tsx.r-1d2f490.r-crgep1.r-orgf3d.r-t60dpp.r-u8s1d.r-zchlnj.r-ipm5af.r-13qz1uu&quot;

// Get all the interests that Twitter has inferred about your account
var interests = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(labelSelector));
console.log(`${interests.length} total interests found`);
var checkedInterests = 0;
console.log(`Starting…`);

// For each of those interests, if it's selected, uncheck the checkbox 
interests.forEach((interest) =&gt; {
    if (interest.checked) {
        checkedInterests++
        interest.click();
        console.log(`${checkedInterests} of ${interests.length}`)
    }
});

console.log(`Finished`);</code></pre>
</div>
<div>
<h1>Remove Suggested Content</h1>

                    Under the
                    <a href=&quot;//twitter.com/settings/add_muted_keyword&quot;>muted keywords</a>
                    section, you paste
                    <a href=&quot;//gist.github.com/IanColdwater/88b3341a7c4c0cf71c73ac56f9bd36ec#gistcomment-3153196&quot;>Jake Bellacera's</a>
                    script to automatically add suggest content keywords to the
                    blocklist, cleaning up your timeline.
                    <pre><code class=&quot;js&quot;>const delayMs = 500; // change this if you feel like its running too fast
const keywords = `ActivityTweet
generic_activity_highlights
generic_activity_momentsbreaking
RankedOrganicTweet
suggest_activity
suggest_activity_feed
suggest_activity_highlights
suggest_activity_tweet
suggest_grouped_tweet_hashtag
suggest_pyle_tweet
suggest_ranked_organic_tweet
suggest_ranked_timeline_tweet
suggest_recap
suggest_recycled_tweet
suggest_recycled_tweet_inline
suggest_sc_tweet
suggest_timeline_tweet
suggest_who_to_follow
suggestactivitytweet

suggestrecycledtweet_inline`.split(/\W+/);

const nativeInputValueSetter = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(window.HTMLInputElement.prototype, &quot;value&quot;).set;

const addMutedKeyword = keyword =&gt; {
    const input = document.querySelector(&quot;[name='keyword']&quot;);
    nativeInputValueSetter.call(input, keyword);
    input.dispatchEvent(new Event('input', { bubbles: true }));
    document.querySelector(&quot;[data-testid='settingsDetailSave']&quot;).click();
}

const delay = () =&gt; {
    return new Promise(res =&gt; setTimeout(res, delayMs));
};

keywords.reduce(async (prev, keyword) =&gt; {
    await prev;
    document.querySelector(&quot;a[href='/settings/add_muted_keyword']&quot;).click();
    await delay();
    addMutedKeyword(keyword);
    return delay();
}, Promise.resolve());</code></pre>
</div>

                ---

                <div>
                    In the end, you should get something less distracting and
                    more focused on the content you enjoy. For example, here's
                    my new homepage:

                    <img alt=&quot;End result&quot; src=&quot;/static/media/posts/suckless-twitter-result.JPG&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%; margin-top: 1em&quot;/>

			<title>NC Importing + Automating Calendars</title>
			<pubDate>Wed, 08 Apr 2020 07:00:00 -0000</pubDate>
			<link>https://mehvix.com/posts/nextcloud-calendar.html</link>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<article id=&quot;content&quot;>
<p>
                    Upgrading to Nextcloud 18 broke both importing public Google
                    calendars and external calendars so that they don’t update
                    automatically. Fortunately, both of these issues have
                    workarounds<br/>
</p>
<h1>Importing Google Calendars</h1>
<p>
                    For external calendars, Nextcloud needs a
                    <code>.ics</code> or <code>.ical</code> file. To add a
                    Google Calendar, we just have to adjust the URL's formatting
                    which you can do automatically using
                    <a href=&quot;//toolbox.mehvix.com/ical-generator/&quot;>this online tool</a>. Alternatively, you can follow the manual method below.
                </p>
<p>
                    For embedded calendars (in this example the
                    <a href=&quot;//codeforces.com/calendar&quot;>Codeforces calendar</a>)
                    you can find the <code>cid</code> by clicking on the plus
                    button in the bottom right corner which will open the
                    following URL:
                </p>
<pre><code class=&quot;ini&quot;>https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?cid=k23j233gtcvau7a8ulk2p360m4@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/Chicago</code></pre>
<p>
                    Alternatively, you can get also use inspect element which
                    will yield the following URL containing the
                    <code>src</code>:
                </p>
<pre><code class=&quot;ini&quot;>https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=k23j233gtcvau7a8ulk2p360m4@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/Chicago&amp;hl=en&amp;wkst=1</code></pre>
<p>
                    Then take everything <strong>after</strong>
<code>src=</code>, <code>cid=</code>, or
                    <code>/ical/</code> and up to the next <code>&amp;</code> sign,
                    oftentimes this will look something like
                    <code>[id]@[group].calendar.google.com</code>. Then, take
                    this string and add it to the following:
                </p>
<pre><code class=&quot;ini&quot;>https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/[add here!]/public/basic.ics</code></pre>
<p>
                    For example, using the Codeforces calendar you'd grab
                    <code>k23j233gtcvau7a8ulk2p360m4@group.calendar.google.com</code>
                    and get the following:
                </p>
<pre><code class=&quot;ini&quot;>https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/k23j233gtcvau7a8ulk2p360m4@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics</code></pre>
<p>
                    You can then use this URL to as the external URL in the
                    Nextcloud Calendar app.
                </p>
<h1>Automatically Updating Calendars</h1>
<p>
                    The default subscription refreshing interval is of one week
                    (unless the subscription itself asks for a different rate).
                </p>
<p>You may override it with something like:</p>
<code>sudo -u www-data php /var/www/html/occ config:app:set dav
                    calendarSubscriptionRefreshRate --value &quot;P1DT6H&quot;</code>
<p>
                    which would set the interval to 1 day and 6 hours. The
                    <code>--value</code> data type is
                    <a href=&quot;//www.php.net/manual/en/dateinterval.construct.php&quot;>DataInterval</a>.

<p>
                    Nextcloud is a FOSS solution for cloud storage, among other
                    capabilities such as email, notes, calender, tasks. Pretty
                    much every thing that you can do with the Google suite, you
                    can use Nextcloud for. For that reasoning,
                </p>
<h1>Basic Installation Step</h1>
<p>
                    We'll start by getting the machine up-to-date and setting up
                    our webserver, apache, with the following commands
                </p>
<pre class=&quot;language-shell&quot;><code>$ sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade
$ sudo apt install apache2
$ systemctl start apache2 # turns on apache now 
$ systemctl enable apache2 # auto-start apache2 on boot</code></pre>
<p>
                    If you’ve configured the server right, you should be able to
                    go to the server’s IP (which you can find by running
                    <code>hostname -I</code>) in the browser of your choice and
                    see the &quot;<a href=&quot;/static/media/posts/apache2page.png&quot;>Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page</a>.&quot;
                </p>
<br/>
<p>Next, we can install MariaDB — the database.</p>
<pre class=&quot;language-shell&quot;><code>$ sudo apt install mariadb-server
$ mysql_secure_installation</code></pre>
<p>
                    During the installation you'll be prompted to login (but we
                    don't have an account setup yet!). Just hit enter and it'll
                    prompt you to create an account. After that, accept all of
                    the recommended prompt options and you’re set. After we've
                    installed the database, we'll then configure it for
                    NextCloud. (note that &quot;<code>Password</code>&quot; will be your
                    own password created during the installation phase).
                </p>
<pre><code class=&quot;language-pgsql&quot;>$ mariadb 
CREATE DATABASE nextcloud;
CREATE USER nextcloud IDENTIFIED BY 'Password';
GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO nextcloud@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'Password';
GRANT ALL privileges ON nextcloud.* TO nextcloud@localhost;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
quit;</code></pre>
<p>
                    While it's not necessary for NextCloud, we'll install
                    phpMyAdmin so that we have a GUI interface to our database.
                </p>
<pre class=&quot;language-shell&quot;><code>$ sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
$ sudo apt install phpmyadmin</code></pre>
<p>
                    When running through the installation dialog, make sure to
                    set the webserver as <code>apache2</code> and follow all of
                    the default options. After the install, we will symlink the
                    apache and phpMyAdmin configurations which, in tandem with
                    the following commands, will enable phpMyAdmin.
                </p>
<pre class=&quot;language-shell&quot;><code>$ sudo ln -s /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf /etc/apache2/conf-available/phpmyadmin.conf
$ a2enconf phpmyadmin
$ service apache2 reload
$ systemctl reload apache2</code></pre>
<p>
                    Now, (fingers crossed) if you go to
                    <code>[server ip]/phpmyadmin/</code>
                    you'll see the phpMyAdmin login page;
                    <strong>however, do not login yet.</strong> We do not have
                    encryption enabled on the web page yet so your ISP or server
                    can theoretically see what you send. We'll setup encryption
                    down the road in a bit.
                </p>
<p>But first, we'll install the required PHP (libraries)</p>
<pre class=&quot;language-shell&quot;><code>$ sudo apt install php-gd php-json php-mysql php-curl php-mbstring php-intl php-imagick php-xml php-zip</code></pre>
<p>as well as NextCloud itself</p>
<pre class=&quot;language-shell&quot;><code>$ wget https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/latest.tar.bz2
$ tar -xvf latest.tar.bz2 # unzip
$ cd nextcloud
$ mv ./* /var/www/html/ # move all files to webserver directory
$ mv ./.htaccess /var/www/html # move hidden dot files
$ mv ./.user.ini /var/www/html # ^
$ cd /var/www/html
$ chown -R www-data:www-data ./* # Recursively set www-data as owner of files
$ chown www-data:www-data .htaccess # ^ for hidden dot files
$ chown www-data:www-data .user.ini # ^</code></pre>
<p>
                    Now if you go to
                    <code>[server ip]</code> you’ll get the Nextcloud page
                    <strong>BUT DO NOT LOGIN / CREATE ACCOUNT</strong>. Again,
                    we still need to set up encryption!
                </p>
<p>
                    To set up encryption, we'll use certbot which we'll install
                    and configure like this:
                </p>
<pre class=&quot;language-shell&quot;><code>$ sudo apt install certbot
$ sudo apt install python-certbot-apache
$ vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf</code></pre>
<p>
                    then uncomment and change <code>ServerName</code> to
                    whatever domain you’re using, such as
                    <code>cloud.mehvix.com</code>.
                </p>
<p>
                    Next, you need to point your domain at your server and open
                    your server to the external access. You’ll first need to
                    port forward your server (you can find the ip via
                    <code>hostname -I</code>) to port <code>443</code>, and then
                    create an A record under your domain’s DNS settings pointing
                    at your external IP (found via
                    <code>dig +short myip.opendns.com
                        @resolver1.opendns.com</code>). <strong>Note</strong> that if you’re using Cloudflare,
                    you have to disable Universal SSL for Nextcloud to work.
                </p>
<p>
                    After making your server open to the WWW, you can finish
                    setting up certbot by restarting the webserver and
                    activating certbot
                </p>
<pre class=&quot;language-shell&quot;><code>$ systemctl restart apache2
$ certbot --apache</code></pre>
<p>
                    Following the set up dialog will prompt you to auto-redirect
                    from http to https. Your choice, but I'd go ahead and choose
                    redirect. Now you can login on the myPhpAdmin/Nextcloud
                    securely!
                </p>
<p>
                    We're not done yet though. For security reasons, it’s a good
                    idea to have the data folder outside of the web root
                    (<code>/var/www/</code>) I already set up my drives/raid
                    config, so all I had to do was create and mount a partition:
                </p>
<pre class=&quot;language-shell&quot;><code>$ mkdir /media/nextcloud-data/
$ chown www-data:www-data /media/nextcloud-data/
$ mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda
$ mount /dev/sda /media/nextcloud-data/</code></pre>
                Then to set up automount, I did <code>sudo blkid</code> to grab
                the UUID of the partition which I then appended to
                <code>/etc/fstab</code>:
                <pre><code class=&quot;language-plaintext&quot;>UUID=[YOUR UUID] /media/nextcloud-data ext4 defaults 0 0</code></pre>
<p>
                    From there, you can go ahead to the Nextcloud page, create
                    an account (you will use this for all NextCloud logins).
                    Make sure to change the data folder to
                    <code>/media/nextcloud-data/</code> or whatever dir you are
                    using, then enter the MariaDB username (nextcloud) and
                    password.<br/><br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
                        Now you’ve got yourself a working Nextcloud
                        Server!</strong>
                    However, there are still a couple things that you still need
                    to configure which I’ll cover in the following section.<br/><br/>

<h1>Securing Nextcloud</h1>

                    If you head to
                    <code>https://yournextcloud.com/settings/admin/overview</code>
                    you’ll see all security and setup warnings. Here’s how you
                    fix the most common:
                </p>

<h1>Further Securing &amp; Optimization</h1>
<p>
                    There are various other actions you can take to ensure that
                    both your os and nextcloud are secure. I’ll be covering the
                    one’s found on
                    <a href=&quot;//docs.nextcloud.com/server/14/admin_manual/configuration_server/harden_server.html&quot;>this wiki page</a>.
                </p>
<h2>Give PHP read access to <code>/dev/urandom</code></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
                        On my system this ended up breaking Nextcloud, but I’ll
                        keep it in here because it’s in the Nextcloud docs. If
                        you’re site breaks, you should try commenting out
                        <code>open_basedir</code><br/>
<code>sudo vim /etc/php/7.4/apache2/php.ini</code><br/>
                        Add <code>open_basedir = /dev/urandom</code><br/>
<code>systemctl restart apache2</code><br/>
</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Install and Tune PHP-FPM</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>sudo apt-get install php-fpm</code><br/>
<code>a2enmod proxy_fcgi setenvif</code><br/>
<code>a2enconf php7.4-fpm</code><br/>
<code>systemctl reload apache2</code><br/>
<code>vim /etc/php/7.4/fpm/pool.d/www.conf</code> and
                        add the following:<br/>
</p>
<pre><code>pm = dynamic
pm.max_children = 120
pm.start_servers = 12
pm.min_spare_servers = 6
pm.max_spare_servers = 18
pm.max_requests = 1000</code></pre>
<p>
<br/>
                        Note that these are the recommended settings for 4GB
                        total/1GB database and should be modified for your
                        system.
                    </p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Quality of Life Changes + Apps</h1>
<p>
                    While theses tips aren’t needed for security, they’re nice
                    to have.
                </p>
<h2>Removing <code>/index.php</code> from every URL</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><code>vim /var/www/html/config/config.php</code></p>
<pre><code>'htaccess.RewriteBase' =&gt; '/'</code></pre>
<p>
<code>sudo -u www-data php /var/www/html/occ
