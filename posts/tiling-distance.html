                <p>
                    This past weekend I was walking around downtown Berkeley
                    with my friends to get

                        ><a href="http://www.kingpindonuts.com/"

                        ></i
                    >
                    when I thought of this contradiction involving the quickest
                    way to traverses a square with infinitely small street
                    blocks street blocks.
                </p>

                <h1>Problem</h1>
                <h2>Setup</h2>

                <p>
                    Consider a <code>1 x 1</code> unit square and a particle
                    starting at the bottom left of the square:
                    <code>(0,0)</code>. This particle wants to move to
                    <code>(1,1)</code>
                    [top right] as quickly as possible while moving only along
                    the edges [streets] of the square. In the
                    <code>1 x 1</code> case, you have two paths each involving
                    two steps: (1) up, right and (2) right, up. Since these
                    paths are symmetric, we'll treat them as a single path. In
                    this single path, we clearly travel a distance of
                    <code>2 units</code> [<code>1 unit per step</code> and
                    <code>2 steps</code>].
                </p>

                <h2>Smaller Blocks</h2>
                <p>
                    Now, what if we divide our existing block into forths; that
                    is, we have four <code>0.5 x 0.5</code> unit squares. Now,
                    consider the following two paths that each take four steps:
                    (1) right, right, up, up and (2) right, up, right, up. Just
                    as the previous <code>1 x 1</code> case, both of these paths
                    travel a total distance of <code>2 units</code> [each of the
                    four steps travels <code>0.5 units</code>].
                </p>
                <p>
                    Say we repeat this dividing of the square
                    <code>n</code> times so our original <code>1 x 1</code> unit
                    block is split into <code>2^n x 2^n</code> sub-blocks, each
                    with side length <code>1/2^n</code>. Now both the outermost
                    and alternating paths each take <code>2 * 2^n</code> steps:
                    (1) right <code>2^n</code> times followed by up
                    <code>2^n</code> more times and (2) right, up
                    <code>2^n</code> times. Again, both travel a total distance
                    of <code>2 units</code> for all <code>n > 0</code>.
                </p>

                <h2>Contradiction</h2>
                <p>
                    However, as we take <code>n</code> to infinity the
                    alternating path looks more and more like particle is
                    travelling along the hypotenuse line from
                    <code>(0,0)</code> to <code>(1,1)</code>. But, we know that
                    the distance traveled is always <code>2 units</code>. How
                    can this be if the particle is travelling along the distance
                    of the hypotenuse which has a distances of
                    <code>√2 units</code>?!
                </p>

                <h1>Explanation</h1>
                <p>
                    This contradiction stumped me for a bit, but I thought of
                    three different ways to explain this seeming contradiction
                    while showering last night.
                </p>

                <h2>1: Kinematics</h2>
                <p>
                    We know that the particle takes a total of
                    <code>2 * n^2</code> steps, each of which are at a constant
                    speed [lets say <code>1 unit/second</code>]. In the original
                    <code>1 x 1</code> case, we travel <code>2 units </code> so
                    we take <code>2 seconds</code>. In each following case, we
                    take just as long since both the speed and distance are
                    constant so we know that the time we travel is constantly
                    <code>2 seconds</code>. Therefore, in the
                    <code>2^n x 2^n</code> sub-blocks case, since we know that
                    we're traveling at a constant <code>1 unit/sec</code> and
                    taking <code>2 seconds</code> meaning we're traveling
                    <code>2 units</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we watched this scenario play out, we would see the
                    particle appearing to move at a speed of
                    <code>1/√2 units/sec</code>. That is, even though the line
                    <i>looks</i> like the hypotenuse, it isn't. This makes sense
                    because we cannot travel along the hypotenuse, no matter how
                    small we get: At the very beginning we said the particle can
                    only move along the edges [streets] of the square, meaning
                    only travel right and up. So when we see the particle travel
                    along the hypotenuse at <code>1/√2 units/sec</code>, we're
                    actually seeing the particle move right and up [or up and
                    right] a tiny amount that we only <i>assume</i> to be along
                    the hypotenuse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Again, the time staying constant because our speed and
                    distance stay the same: we keep moving
                    <code>1 unit/sec</code> and we travel a distance [2 for
                    up/right] * [paths] * [distance/path] =
                    <code>2 * 2^n * 1/2^n = 2</code> so we take
                    <code>2 seconds</code> to traverse the grid even as we push
                    <code>n</code> to infinity.
                </p>

                <h2>2: Additive</h2>
                <p>
                    Instead of dividing the square into sub-squares, what if we
                    tiled instead so that we doubled each existing square. That
                    is, we'd start with a single <code>1 x 1</code> unit block,
                    then grow to <code>2 x 2, 4 x 4, 8 x 8, ...</code> etc.
                    However, while we exponentially increase perimeter, we'll
                    also increased our speed proportionally [starting at
                    <code>1</code> unit/sec, then
                    <code>2, 4, 8, ...</code> units/sec]. That way, the particle
                    will always take 2 seconds to complete the square.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to seeing that this 2 seconds is a constant for
                    any resolution, we can also see that the two steps of both
                    right and up movements are finite distances. That means that
                    both the up and right movements are not, and cannot ever, be
                    treated as a single move diagonally [this is what we
                    implicitly assumed was happening when the sub-square sides
                    were of length
                    <code>1/2^n x 1/2^n</code>].
                </p>

                <h2>3: Limit</h2>
                <p>
                    Adding on to the explanation involving tiling above, we can
                    write an equation to relate the total distance traveled
                    [units] per speed [in units/sec]: <code>2n/n</code>. With
                    this, we can take the limit of <code>n</code> to infinity
                    and clearly this ends up as <code>2</code>. This result has
                    the units <code>seconds</code> which is consistent with our
                    other for the particle to travel all paths.
                </p>

                <h1>Implications given Constraint</h1>
                <p>
                    With that being said, this seems to say that travelling
                    eight blocks east and eight blocks north should take the
                    same time as travelling east then north eight times (eight
                    is arbitrary).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the real world, this isn't often true<sup
                        ><a href="#1-ref" id="1-exp">1</a></sup
                    >. Blocks aren't perfect rectangles made from streets and
                    your steps are rarely parallel/orthogonal to the x/y axis
                    so, unlike the idealized example, you're rarely moving in
                    just the x or y direction at a single time. Regardless, I
                    still think it's an interesting thought puzzle of sorts.
