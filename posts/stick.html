                <a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/people/shenker">Scott Shenker</a> gave a <a
                    href="https://youtu.be/3d1dLT6yMyA">talk</a> in my networking class where he shared an anecdote that went
                something like this:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                To give some background, I did my training as a theoretical physicist: I took a postdoc in physics
                and then I joined Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Xerox PARC was basically where Modern PCs and
                interfaces were invented: it's where Apple.. I don't want to say stole, since Steve
                Job visited and we showed him all the technology. But that's what the Macintosh was built on, was
                copying these ideas.
                <br>
                <br>
                I arrived in 1984 and a year and a half after I joined <a href="https://jnd.org/">Don Norman</a>, the lead
                UI designer at Apple, came to visit Xerox PARC. Now I was a physicist so my ego was not involved in this but
                certainly the computer scientists thought <i>'we invented this stuff! we know about user interfaces! how
                    could somebody come and tell us, you who built the Mac--this cheap piece of shit--how dare you come and
                    try and tell us how to build user interfaces!'</i>
                <br>
                <br>
                The auditorium was packed with 300 Engineers, lots of energy in the room. Don Norman, this charismatic man
                who's even older than I am, just walks up to the podium and looks out at us for for what felt like forever (but
                it was probably 30 seconds) before asking "How many of you drive a stick shift?" And it's a bunch of male
                engineers so a bunch of hands went up and you could tell it was 'well <i>I</i> drive a stick shift!'
                <br>
                <br>
                He looks at us and says "None of you should <sc>Ever</sc> design a user interface!"
            </blockquote>

                Mastering complexity is valuable: it is crucial when developing novel systems. It is also an indicator of
                enjoying the process--learning the skills, nuances, mindset--needed to cope with said complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
                These motivations are orthogonal to the goal of design: to extract simplicity, abolishing complexity. If you
                are an enjoyer of mastering complexity, your innate mental attitude will blind you from recognizing the
                grooves you have learned, making you incapable of extracting simplicity. It is the difference of low and high
                level perspectives. You will never succeed in design if you do not recognize that it involves an entirely
                different set of skills with respect to mastering
                complexity.
