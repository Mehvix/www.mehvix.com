            <p>
                <a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/people/shenker">Scott Shenker</a> gave a <a href="https://youtu.be/3d1dLT6yMyA">talk</a> in my networking class where he shared an anecdote that went
                something like this:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                To give some background, I did my training as a theoretical physicist: I took a postdoc in physics
                and then I joined Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Xerox PARC was basically where Modern PCs and
                interfaces were invented: it's where Apple.. I don't want to say stole, since Steve
                Job visited and we showed him all the technology. But that's what the Macintosh was built on, was
                copying these ideas.
                <br>
                <br>
                I arrived in 1984 and a year and a half after I joined <a href="https://jnd.org/">Don Norman</a>, the lead
                UI designer at Apple, came to visit Xerox PARC. Now I was a physicist so my ego was not involved in this but
                certainly the computer scientists thought <i>'we invented this stuff! we know about user interfaces! how
                    could somebody come and tell us, you who built the Mac--this cheap piece of shit--how dare you come and
                    try and tell us how to build user interfaces!'</i>
                <br>
                <br>
                The auditorium was packed with 300 Engineers, lots of energy in the room. Don Norman, this charismatic man
                who's even older than I am, just walks up to the podium and looks out at us for for what felt like forever (but
                it was probably 30 seconds) before asking "How many of you drive a stick shift?" And it's a bunch of male
                engineers so a bunch of hands went up and you could tell it was 'well <i>I</i> drive a stick shift!'
                <br>
                <br>
                He looks at us and says "None of you should <sc>Ever</sc> design a user interface!"
            </blockquote>

                <i>Mastering Complexity</i> is valuable: it is crucial when developing novel systems. It is also an indicator of
                enjoying the process--learning the skills, nuances, mindset--needed to cope with said complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Driving stick embodies the act of <i>Mastering Complexity</i>, and for the sake of itself: the practice is a
                feedback loop of constant refinement, sharpening the axe by focusing the subtle nuances. <a href="https://youtu.be/LK2uDUndpww?t=10">Van argues it is a creative exercise</a>; an
                endeavor that (in the states) is the inconvenient, non-default route -- you must yearn to pursue the practice. In
                the
                same vein, you are "that guy" if you learn drive stick (ala <a href="./colemak.html">colemake-dh</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                These motivations, may be creative in spirit, yet are orthogonal to the goal of design: to extract simplicity;
                abolish
                complexity. If you are an enjoyer of <i>Mastering Complexity</i>, your innate state will blind you from recognizing
                the mental grooves you've developed alongside constructing [software, user experience, etc.]. You cannot
                succeed in design if you do not consciously curb this ethos.
