                Say we have a sphere with 10% of it's surface area painted in blue and the remaining 90% red. We want to
                show that, no matter how the sphere is painted, we can always <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inscribed_figure">inscribe</a> a cube inside such that it's 8
                corners
                (vertices) are all touching red.
                <hr>
                Formalizing this in terms of probabilities, we operate over the space $\Omega$ of all possible sphere
                paintings. We know that if we randomly placed a vertex $i$, the chance of it being red is
                $\mathbb{P}(R_i) =
                0.9$
                and similarly $\mathbb{P}(B_i) = 0.1$. Thus we can state our problem as:

                $$
                \begin{align}
                \mathbb{P}\left(\bigcap^8_{i=1} R_i \right) &= 1 - \mathbb{P}\left(\bigcup^8_{i=1} B_i \right) \\
                &\geq 1- \sum_{i=1}^8 \mathbb{P}(B_i) \\
                &= 1 - 8 \cdot 0.1 \\
                &= 0.2 \\
                &\neq 0 \iff \bigcap^8_{i=1} R_i \in \Omega
                \end{align}
                $$

                In other words, we showed that some event (with the property of having all 8 vertices be red) is
                non-zero. This works because to show that some specific element $\omega \in \Omega$, it is sufficient to show that
                there exists a probability distribution $p$ over $\Omega$ where $p(\omega) > 0$. This follows from the
                fact that if $\omega \not\in \Omega$ then $p(\omega) = p(\varnothing) = 0$. This proof technique is called <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_method">The Probabilistic Method</a> and is notably
                non-constructive: given the sphere's blue coloring, it does not show how to orient a cube, rather,
                it shows that there exists some orientation regardless of the exact blue locations (as opposed to a
                constructive proof, i.e. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hVPNONm7xw">this hat puzzle</a>
                <spoil>
                    where events 10 events of 10% likelihood are constructed in such a way to ensure mutually exclusivity, implying a
                    zero chance of all events not occurring.
                </spoil>.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Talking around, Aidan (<a href="/posts/tiling-distance.html">cowboy hat</a>) came up with another proof.
                Essentially, each of the eight points correspond to an octant with $100/8 = 12.5\%$ surface area. And as
                any
                $c\%$ is painted in any single octant, the other seven will be similarly constrained: there will be a
                corresponding $c\%$ 'implicitly painted' in all others such that placing a vertex in this area will result in at least
                one other vertex to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68ugkg9RePc">blue</a>. Thus we can view the problem as
                an issue of covering an octant's $12.5\%$ surface area given $10\%$ blue --
                impossible! The proof is a tad handwavy, but gives a sense of how we could collapse the octants to reveal the (minimally
                $2.5\%$) remaining red area and thus construct a valid orientation.
