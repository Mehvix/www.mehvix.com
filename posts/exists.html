                Say we have a sphere with 10% of it's surface area painted in blue and the remaining 90% red. We want to
                show that, no matter how the sphere is painted, we can always <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inscribed_figure">inscribe</a> a cube inside such that it's 8 corners
                (vertices) are all touching red.
                <hr>
                Formalizing this in terms of probabilities, we operate over the space $\Omega$ of all possible sphere
                paintings. We know that if we randomly placed a vertex $i$, the chance of it being red is $\mathbb{P}(R_i) =
                0.9$
                and similarly $\mathbb{P}(B_i) = 0.1$. Thus we can state our problem as:

                $$
                \begin{align}
                \mathbb{P}\left(\bigcap^8_{i=1} R_i \right) &= 1 - \mathbb{P}\left(\bigcup^8_{i=1} B_i \right) \\
                &\geq 1- \sum_{i=1}^8 \mathbb{P}(B_i) \\
                &= 1 - 8 \cdot 0.1 \\
                &= 0.2 \\
                &\neq 0 \iff \bigcap^8_{i=1} R_i \in \Omega
                \end{align}
                $$

                In other words, we showed that some event (with the property of having all 8 vertices be red) is non-zero.
                This works because to show that some specific element $\omega \in \Omega$, it is sufficient to show that
                there exists a probability distribution $p$ over $\Omega$ where $p(\omega) > 0$. This follows from the fact
                that if $\omega \not\in \Omega$ then $p(\omega) = p(\varnothing) = 0$. This proof technique is called <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_method">The Probabilistic Method</a> and notably
                non-constructive: given the sphere's blue coloring, it does not show how to orient a cube, rather,
                it shows that there exists some orientation regardless of the exact blue locations.

                Talking around, Aidan (<a href="/posts/tiling-distance.html">cowboy hat</a>) came up with another proof.
                Essentially, each of the eight sphere octants around each of the eight points contains $100/8 = 12.5\%$ of
                the total surface area. And as any $c\%$ is painted in one octant, the other seven octants will be
                constrained similarly: there will be a corresponding $c\%$ 'implicitly painted' such that placing a vertex in
                this area will cause another vertex to be blue. Thus we can view the problem as an issue of covering an
                octant's $12.5\%$ surface area given $10\%$ blue -- impossible! The proof is a tad handwavy, but gives a
                sense of how we could construct an orientation by collapsing each octants into a single one that reveals the
                (minimally $2.5\%$) remaining, valid red area.
