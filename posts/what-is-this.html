                <p>
                    Answering the title: I'm not really sure (yet)! I bought the
                    domain for my
                    <a href="/serverservices.html">server service</a> and
                    figured I may as well have a webpage for the primary domain.
                    Right now, this site's main purpose is for hosting guides I
                    can link friends and family to. Right now I've got a few
                    other guide ideas I've jotted down but haven't gotten around
                    to — now that school is winding down, I'm hoping to get
                    around to those.

                    Beyond guides, I've got a few other actual "blog" type ideas
                    but (1) I'm not sure people want to read some high school
                    student's ramblings and (2) I've realized that I suck at
                    writing just for the sake of writing. The past four years of
                    High School English have drilled in not much more than 1-3-1
                    essays (one intro paragraph, three body paragraphs, one
                    conclusion paragraph for those outside of American public
                    education). While, sure, this works for AP Exams, beyond
                    that it's been negligible — college apps took waaayyyy
                    longer than they should have, I've got a bad case of staring
                    at emails for 10 minutes before hitting send, and even just
                    writing casually like this is <i>weird</i>(?). Maybe I'll
                    try just writing my ideas down for the hell of it and I can
                    look back in a few years and make fun of my self.
