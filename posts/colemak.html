                        I have now typed in Colemak for 391 days in a row, so I
                        feel somewhat qualified to tell you why you should
                        consider (not) switching your keyboard layout.

                        Colemak is a modern alternative to the QWERTY and Dvorak
                        layouts, designed for efficient and ergonomic touch
                        typing in English. Learning Colemak is a one-time
                        investment that will allow you to enjoy faster and
                        pain-free typing for the rest of your life (<a

                    <p>
                        Simply, Colemak places the most commonly typed letters
                        (based on the English language) on the home row and
                        determines the position of the rest by accounting for
                        finger distance, row jumping, same-finger typing
                        <a href="https://colemak.com/Ergonomic">etc</a>,

                <h1>Why Not</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Switching to Colemak takes long. And is just hard. You
                        have to break your old muscle memory. Typing is going to
                        be a slow, ugly drudge for a while. I got back to
                        averaging 70 WPM (my OG QWERTY speed) after a (long)
                        month. Then again, my roommate Jack got back 84 WPM
                        after two days (he was formerly avg 140)-- this is a
                        developing situation (he just got 84 five minutes ago)
                        but at this rate I'm sure he'll get 140 by the end of
                        the week. This is the hardest part of the whole process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After you learn Colemak, good luck using other people's
                        computers. It's embarrassing. When you learn Colemak,
                        you have to destroy all your pre-existing typing habits,
                        thus, you (need to) forget QWERTY (on a regular
                        keyboard, phone fine). I now carry around a USB with
                        Windows/Linux Colemak files (which isn't terrible since
                        I always have a password-backup USB on me). Regardless,
                        it's a hassle. Additionally, sometimes you do not have
                        permissions to install layouts (school/works computers).
                        To circumvent this, I was looking into building a
                        physical middle-man between the keyboard and computer
                        using an Arduino. The parts arrived but now that I'm at
                        Berkeley and I have no free time (or, there are more
                        fulfilling things to do with my free time). Maybe this
                        summer. Anyways, more reasons not to use Colemak:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you use
                        <a href="./win-insecure-files.html">VeraCrypt</a> or any
                        other encryption system that requires unlocking the
                        drive prior to the operating system loading (so, yes,
                        LUKS) then typing your password is pain: your keyboard
                        will be typing in QWERTY (unless you have a hardware
                        Colemak keyboard, which you probably shouldn't). You can
                        circumvent this by setting your keyboard layout
                        temporarily to QWERTY, then typing your password like
                        you normally would (just type what you would by pressing
                        the keys as if they were Colemak), and you're set.
                        Additionally, some (most) of Linux DE's do not load the
                        layout on the initial lock screen so you'll have to
                        slowly type it out. I've found that after a while my
                        brain can store the QWERTY-muscle memory of my most
                        common passwords so it's not terrible after you encode
                        the important/common ones in your brain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vim is not as slick: your movement keys aren't in the
                        same proximity. You can rebind the keys, of course, but
                        out of the box (ex. when you SSH into a machine) it's
                        annoying. More generally, shortcuts may be more a hassle
                        for other programs. For what it's worth, Colemak does
                        have <code>C</code> and <code>V</code> unchanged (for
                        copy / paste respectively) unlike Dvorak.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, I can only imagine it's fairly easy to
                        fingerprint Colemak (or really any non-mainstream
                        layout) users, either through reading the current
                        keyboard layout or by unique, colemak-specific typing
                        mannerisms (look up 'Behavioral Biometrics'). This only
                        matters if you're a privacy nut or Snowden-level wanted.

                        Summary: the hardest part is the first month (getting
                        back to your old WPM). The rest of the reasons are
                        mostly small nuisances and edge cases that you can judge
                        if they matter.

                        It's fun to learn as a challenge. If you like learning
                        skills, this is one of the ones to at least try out. I
                        can tell you it's more useful than knowing morse-code
                        (besides perhaps <code>...---...</code>) and around the
                        same impressiveness as being able to solve a rubik's
                        cube. It's also fun to type: if you go online you'll see
                        people talking about the sweet '<a
                            href="https://forum.colemak.com/topic/802-finger-rolls/"
                            >finger rolls</a
                        >' that Colemak is conductive to. If you switch, type
                        'tenderheartednesses' and you'll see.

                        You will probably get faster. Then again, I may have
                        gotten equally better had I spend this time and focus
                        towards improving regular typing. Anyways, I went from
                        averaging 70 to 100 WPM. Below is my progress on
                        monkeytype:

                    <p>
                        To end this post, I'm actually a liar! I use a
                        derivative of Colemak, called
                        <a href="https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/"
                            >Colemak-DH</a
                        >, which has a few other additional tweaks you can read
                        about on the website. Skim it and choose if you want it
                        or Colemakâ€”â€” it really doesn't matter all that much. One
                        minor thing is that base Colemak is included Manjaro
                        (and presumably other distros) while -DH is not (making
                        set up a bit more painful.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you do decide to take the Colemak pill, set aside a
                        weekend where you are okay being unproductive while
                        using a computer. To learn Colemak, you have to use it
                        lots. You can't swap back between it and QWERTY, so you
                        have to grind back to an acceptable WPM.

                        After running the installer (<a

                            >colemak.academy</a

                        <a href="https://monkeytype.com/">monkeytype</a>. This
                        is what I recommend to others, and how my roommate Jack
                        is learning very quickly. You may also want to checkout
                        the

                        >
                        to see what's worked for others. Ultimately, it boils
                        down to focusing on breaking your old habits. If you
                        think that sounds lke a fun challenge, highly
                        recommended!
