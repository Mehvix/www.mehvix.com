                <p>
                    Okay so for the past month I wasted a lot of my time
                    (binging
                    <a href="//yewtu.be/channel/UCYwVxWpjeKFWwu8TML-Te9A">JCS</a
                    >, playing
                    <a href="//store.steampowered.com/app/629760/MORDHAU/"
                        >Mordhau</a
                    >, doomscrolling) and I think writing out my general summer
                    goals will be helpful for a couple reasons: (1) even though
                    few people I know read this blog, I hope I'll feel some
                    amount of accountability to follow through, (2) when people
                    ask me what I'm doing I hope to not give ad-hoc answers, (3)
                    I think writing in general makes me think more deeply about
                    the content, and I want to think more deeply about my goals
                    and (4) I think it'll be interesting to look back this in
                    the fall and beyond.
                </p>

                <h1>Chess</h1>
                <p>
                    I've been split between trying to improve at either Age of
                    Empires II, Poker, or Chess. AoE is stressful to play and I
                    don't want to ruin the childhood nostalgia I have for it.
                    They're also releasing co-op campaigns and I think that'll
                    be more fun than 1v1 Arabia wars. As for Poker, I enjoy it
                    in-person with friends but I'd suspect none of my friends
                    would want to grind it as much as I would want to this
                    summer, leaving only online. While crypto has revived online
                    to some degree, I think it's hard to improve online because
                    you tend not to play with the same people and you don't have
                    the fun of in-person tells. Also I don't want to go broke.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That leaves Chess, which is probably my weakest of the
                    three. I'm not really sure where to start right now. This
                    past week I've been working through puzzles on LiChess, but
                    I don't think I have a (strong) foundation. I know control
                    middle, don't fuck up your pawn structure, and don't do
                    <a href="//youtu.be/e91M0XLX7Jw">this</a>. I've got
                    <a
                        href="//www.masterclass.com/classes/garry-kasparov-teaches-chess"
                        >Kasparov's Masterclass</a
                    >
                    downloaded which I may binge through to get a sense of where
                    to start. I've also got friends who already play and are
                    very good (at least seem very good to me, probably how I
                    seem 'good' at AoE to them) so maybe I can get some
                    coaching.
                </p>

                <h1>Friends</h1>
                <p>
                    It didn't hit me that
                    <i
                        >"wow I'm not going to see most of my classmates ever
                        again"</i
                    >
                    until maybe a week after graduation. And I'm still now sure
                    how I feel about that. Asking my self
                    <i>
                        "how do I want to spend my last summer where I will have
                        the least number of responsibilities"
                    </i>
                    was a wake-up call to spend more time in-person with my
                    friends (especially compared to spending time pubbing TF2 or
                    binging Sopranos a third time). And to be realistic, I
                    probably won't keep in touch with 80% of them after freshmen
                    year â€“ when I began to focus on academics and robotics
                    Sophomore year, I only kept in touch with maybe three main
                    friends (and that was when I would see my main friend group
                    nearly every day).

                        href="//artofproblemsolving.com/community/c1080751h2594496"
                        >David and I have been hiking twice this week</a
                    >
                    which has been fun (and I can sub in hiking for running in
                    my workout, I hate running). I've been using
                    <a href="//www.alltrails.com/">AllTrails</a> which has a big
                    enough userbase near Madison that there are fairly accurate
                    and up-to-date reviews and statistics of nearby places.
                    Maybe I'll make a post later once we hit all the nearby
                    places summarizing my thoughts. Also, Aidan's getting back
                    from rowing competitions next week so I'm hoping we can wrap
                    up our Pathfinder game and go fishing with the fellas like
                    last summer.
                </p>

                <h1>Read</h1>
                <p>
                    I haven't read for the sake of reading in a long time. It's
                    gotten to the point where I have a que of books that I've
                    asked for over the years just sitting on my shelf. Two years
                    back, I started scheduling my day down to the 15-minute mark
                    and I think I've never given my self the opportunity to sit
                    down for an extended period of time and read. It's crazy to
                    think that I read as much as I did when I did those library
                    summer reading programs (Now that I think of it, I was so
                    cool that I used to do two library's reading programs at
                    once).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyways, last week I started
                    <a
                        href="//www.goodreads.com/book/show/113537.Positively_Fifth_Street"
                        >Positively Fifth Street</a
                    >
                    and I have
                    <a href="//www.goodreads.com/book/show/662.Atlas_Shrugged"
                        >Atlas Shrugged</a
                    >,
                    <a
                        href="//www.goodreads.com/book/show/45363333-harassment-architecture"
                        >Harassment Architecture</a
                    >, and
                    <a href="//www.goodreads.com/book/show/135479.Cat_s_Cradle"
                        >Cat's Cradle</a
                    >
                    ready on my bookshelf. Using
                    <a href="http://wordcounters.com">this site</a> to figure
                    out word counts, it's around 500,000 words in all (for what
                    it's worth, Rand's work is 327k). Lets say I can read 250
                    words a minute and I have six weeks left of summer. Doing
                    the math, I need to read about an hour a day. I know I do
                    anything best when I'm in
                    <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a
                    >, so I think I'll try and read my seven hours in two
                    sessions each week. I don't want to schedule reading down to
                    the hour, rather just set the expectation of
                    <i>"I'm going to read this afternoon"</i> so I avoid
                    overloading my mind during those sessions.
                </p>

                <h1>Don't 'Learn', Do Projects</h1>
                <p>
                    This may just be me, but I do not enjoy learning all the
                    nuances behind learning a programming language. I like
                    diving in head first. I learned my first language, Python,
                    by dicking around with
                    <a href="//github.com/Rapptz/discord.py">discord.py</a>
                    and building a
                    <a href="//github.com/mehvix/synapsbot-rw">Discord bot</a>
                    my freshmen summer. I doubt that I wouldn't have learned
                    nearly as much compared to if I had followed a course.
                    That's not to say that courses don't have good content, I
                    would've gotten bored.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example: Two weeks ago I tried learning C++ from the
                    start with
                    <a href="http://learncpp.com">learncpp.com</a> and it was
                    tedious. Nothing against the site, but it a time sink
                    because I'd have to go page after page skimming past stuff I
                    already knew while trying to pick out what knowledge I
                    didn't already know. Compare this to me learning Ruby a
                    month ago when I threw together an
                    <a href="//github.com/Mehvix/aops-blog-rss"
                        >RSS generator for AoPS</a
                    >
                    : I learned all sorts of stuff not only about Ruby, but also
                    about Heroku and the steps behind getting code from my PC to
                    a server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That being said, while I've got a huuuge backload of
                    projects in my
                    <a href="/todo.html">todo list</a> I honestly have lost the
                    spark-of-interest I previously had for most of them.
                    Throughout this summer, I don't want to force myself to work
                    on something I'm not actively interested in. Rather, I want
                    to work on projects spontaneously when ideas come to me â€“
                    that's when I learn most. After all, I'll have at least four
                    years to formally learn information and follow class
                    projects :p.
